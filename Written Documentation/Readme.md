### The Mechanics of Machine Learning
To tackle these classes of problems, we’ll have to use a very different kind of
approach. A lot of the things we learn in school growing up have a lot in common
with traditional computer programs. We learn how to multiply numbers, solve equa‐
tions, and take derivatives by internalizing a set of instructions. But the things we
learn at an extremely early age, the things we find most natural, are learned by exam‐
ple, not by formula.
For instance, when we were two years old, our parents didn’t teach us how to recog‐
nize a dog by measuring the shape of its nose or the contours of its body. We learned
to recognize a dog by being shown multiple examples and being corrected when we
made the wrong guess. In other words, when we were born, our brains provided us
with a model that described how we would be able to see the world. As we grew up,
that model would take in our sensory inputs and make a guess about what we were
