### The Mechanics of Machine Learning 
(Fundamentals of Deep Learning
by Nikhil Buduma and Nicholas Lacascio)

To tackle these classes of problems, we’ll have to use a very different kind of
approach. A lot of the things we learn in school growing up have a lot in common
with traditional computer programs. We learn how to multiply numbers, solve equa‐
tions, and take derivatives by internalizing a set of instructions. But the things we
learn at an extremely early age, the things we find most natural, are learned by exam‐
ple, not by formula.
For instance, when we were two years old, our parents didn’t teach us how to recog‐
nize a dog by measuring the shape of its nose or the contours of its body. We learned
to recognize a dog by being shown multiple examples and being corrected when we
made the wrong guess. In other words, when we were born, our brains provided us
with a model that described how we would be able to see the world. As we grew up,
that model would take in our sensory inputs and make a guess about what we were
experiencing. If that guess was confirmed by our parents, our model would be rein‐
forced. If our parents said we were wrong, we’d modify our model to incorporate this
new information. Over our lifetime, our model becomes more and more accurate as
we assimilate more and more examples. Obviously all of this happens subconsciously,
without us even realizing it, but we can use this to our advantage nonetheless.
Deep learning is a subset of a more general field of artificial intelligence
called machine learning, which is predicated on this idea of learning from example. In
machine learning, instead of teaching a computer a massive list of rules to solve the
problem, we give it a model with which it can evaluate examples, and a small set of
instructions to modify the model when it makes a mistake. We expect that, ov
